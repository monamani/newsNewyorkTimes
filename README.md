**Flutter NewYorkTimes App**

News App developed with Flutter and API from NYTimes API


**Why Flutter:**

With Flutter we can build high quality natively compiled apps for iOS and Android quickly,
without having to write the code for the two apps separately. 


**Run the app :**
 1. Install Flutter 
 2. Clone the project 
 3. Run this command : flutter run lib/main.dart

**Feature**

1. Splash Screen : On that page we show the logo and a loader will be redirect 
to the list of news when all the news are properly loaded
2. News List : Listing the most viewed news on the last 7 days on all the sections 
3. News Details : will show the image and a brief description and when u click to the button
you will be redirect to the full article [I used webview to open it inside the application
without redirection to the browser]

**Important Parts:**

 [x] Fetch news from API.
 
 [x] Parse complicated JSON.

**Packages Used**

  http: Used to get the data from the API 
  
  webview_flutter:  To open the article url inside the app
